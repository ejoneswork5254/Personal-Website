            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Ethan Jones, a computer science student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. With a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving, I’m passionate about blending technical expertise with creativity to build impactful solutions. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring storytelling through YouTube videos and socializing as the Vice President and Social Chair of my fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi.

                I thrive in collaborative environments, whether it’s tackling technical challenges in small teams or organizing events that bring people together. With a strong focus on personal growth and a balanced approach to work and life, I’m committed to building a fulfilling career while staying grounded in the communities I care about.
                
                In my free time, you’ll find me diving into video games, experimenting with creative projects, or engaging in lighthearted yet meaningful conversations.</p>

                    <p>I have two years of experience studying computer science, complemented by a semester of electrical engineering coursework, giving me a strong technical foundation. During my undergraduate journey, I contributed to research projects that deepened my knowledge of Python and problem-solving. Currently, I work for a financial company, where I’ve honed my professional and analytical skills. I’m now seeking new opportunities to leverage my diverse technical background and hands-on experience to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.</p>

                    <p>As the Social Chair of my fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, I successfully organized events that fostered connection and engagement among members while balancing the demands of my academic schedule. Now, as Vice President, I’ve taken on greater leadership responsibilities, overseeing operations and supporting the growth of our chapter. These roles have strengthened my organizational, communication, and teamwork skills, which I’m excited to bring to future opportunities.</p>
